## Introduction

Welcome to **DocSwap**, the app that allows South African MBChB Interns to find their perfect internship placement!

## How does it work?

- **Placement & Choice Submission**: Once you have found out where you have been placed for internship, visit [DocSwap](https://docswap.streamlit.app/), read the disclaimer, and confirm that you are an MBChB Candidate going into their first year of internship. Once you have done this, a Google form link will appear, fill out your current placement and top 3 alternative choices on this form.

- **Swap Matching**: Once your choices have been submitted our algorithm begins searching for multiway swaps while prioritising higher choices!

- **Email Notifications**: If a suitable swap is found you will get an email from `docswapza@gmail.com`. The other Doctor(s) in your swap will be CC'd in the email and you will receive instructions on who should swap with who.

- **Swap Statistics**: Under the Swap Statistics tab you will be able to see how many people are using DocSwap, how many swaps have been found and which hospitals people are swapping.
