                        Most swaps are typically done on Facebook or WhatsApp groups, one of the biggest challenges with this is that you cannot keep track of everyone's choices and so it can be tough to coordinate swaps with more than 3 people.

                        Consider a 3-party swap:
                        
                        - Person A has Person B's choice but Person B does not have Person A's choice
                        - So Person A would not consider Swapping with Person B as they would not get their choice in return. 
                        - If Person B could find a third Person with willing to swap with them for Person A's choice they could then Swap with Person A and all 3 parties would be satisfied.

                        On the left we have a diagram of a 5-party swap, imagine the logistical nightmare to achieve this considering none of them can directly swap with each other
