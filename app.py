                        Most swaps are typically done on Facebook or WhatsApp groups, one of the biggest challenges with this is that you cannot keep track of everyone's choices and so it can be tough to coordinate swaps with more than 3 people.

                        Consider a 3-party swap:

                        - If Person B could find a third Person with willing to swap with them for Person A's choice they could then Swap with Person A and all 3 parties would be satisfied.
